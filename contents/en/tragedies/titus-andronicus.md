# Titus Andronicus

The Roman general, Titus Andronicus returns to a hero’s welcome after defeating
the Goths in a ten-year campaign. Among his captives are the queen of the Goths,
Tamora, and her three sons, Alarbus, Demetrius and Chiron. Also accompanying her
is herlover Aaron, a Moor. Titus has lost many sons in the war.

To give them a fitting funeral, Lucius, one of Titus’s three surviving sons,
suggests a human sacrifice. Titus singles out Alarbus, Tamora’s eldest son and
although she pleads for her son’s life Titus is unrelenting. Lucius seizes
Alarbus. And he and his men hew his limbs and make a sacrifice of him.

The emperor dies and the crown is available. When it is offered to Titus, he
declines and recommends Saturninus, the oldest son of the dead emperor. He
suggests that Saturninus take his beautiful daughter Lavinia as his wife and
empress.

After Saturninus is crowned, he frees Tamora and her sons. Bassianus, Saturninus’
brother objects, to the proposed marriage of Saturninus and Lavinia because
Lavinia is already betrothed to him. With the help of Lavinia’s brothers, he
steals her away. Titus is angered and he kills his son Mucius when he tries to
prevent Titus from pursuing thelovers. Later, Saturninus decides that he prefers
Tamora to Lavinia, then marries Tamora and makes her empress. Tamora begins
plotting revenge against Titus for allowing the slaughter of her son. Before the
palace, Tamora’s lover, Aaron, exalts Tamora and predicts that she will bring
ruin to Rome.

Tamora’s sons Demetrius and Chiron have both fallen in love with Lavinia and
they quarrel over her. Her. Each claims the right to take her from Bassianus.
After failing to dissuade them from pursuing her, Aaron suggests that they share
the lovely Lavinia by taking turns raping her in the seclusion of a forest. The
occasion will come during a hunt in the woods for game. Emperor Saturninus,
Queen Tamora, and many others are to take part in the hunt. On the day of the
hunt, Aaron and Tamora rendezvous in the woods. Aaron gives her a letter to
present to Saturninus. Its contents will aid Tamora’s desire to bring down Titus.

When Bassianus and Lavinia discover Aaron and Tamora together, Tamora fears that
the intruders will tell the emperor. S he calls out for her sons. When they
arrive, Tamora pretends Bassianus has threatened her. The sons kill Bassianusand
throw him in a pit, then drag Lavinia off to rape her. Not only do they rape her,
they also mutilate her, cutting off her hands and tearing out her tongue. Aaron
leads Titus’s sons Quintus and Martius toward the pit where Bassianus lies dead.
Martius falls in. While Aaron goes to fetch Saturninus, Quintus falls in, too,
trying to rescue Martius. Saturninus arrives with Aaron. With them are Titus,
Lucius, and attendants. Martius, who has discovered the body, informs Saturninus
that his brother, Bassianus, is dead. Tamora then presents Aaron’s letter to
Saturninus. It falsely implicates Martius and Quintus in the murder of Bassianus.

Saturninus imprisons them and the court later sentences them to death in spite
of Titus’s pleas on their behalf. Laviniacannot testify in their favor, for she
has no tongue. When Titus, Lucius, and Titus’s brother Marcus discuss their
options, the evil Aaron arrives and tells them that Saturninus will free the
sons of Titus if Marcus, Lucius, or Titus cuts off his hand and sends it to the
emperor. It is Titus, though, who allows Aaron to cut off his hand and take it
to Saturninus. Within a half hour, however, the emperor returns the hand,
together with the heads of Titus’s imprisoned sons, in a show of scorn and
contempt. Titus orders his son Lucius to flee the city and enlist an army of
Goths to overthrow Saturninus. The loss of his sons takes a severe toll on Titus.
He begins to go mad. Then Lavinia informs Titus and others about her rape and
mutilation by writing in sand with a stick held in her mouth.

Meanwhile, Tamora has a baby. It is obviously Aaron’s because it has the dark
complexion of a Moor. Worried that the emperor will find out about it, Tamora
wants it killed. Aaron has other plans. First, he kills the baby’s midwife and
nurse to keep secret the baby’s existence. Next, he substitutes a white baby for
his own, then leaves with his child to go to the Goths to have them raise it.
……. By this time, Lucius is marching on Rome with his army of Goths. Aaron and
his baby, who have been captured, appear. Aaron agrees to tell all he knows if
his child is allowed to live. Titus cuts the throats of Tamora’s sons Demetrius
and Chiron, then has a pie prepared of their flesh and serves it to Saturninus
and Tamora. He kills Lavinia to put her out of her misery, then kills Tamora.
Saturninus kills Titus in retaliation, and Lucius kills Saturninus. Lucius takes
command of Rome as the new emperor. Lucius orders Aaron to be buried up to his
chest and starved to death.
