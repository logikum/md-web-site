# Antony and Cleopatra

After defeating Brutus and Cassius, following the assassination of Julius Caesar,
Mark Antony becomes one of the three rulers of the Roman Empire, together with
Octavius Caesar and Lepidus, and is responsible for the eastern part of the
empire. He falls in love with Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt, and settles in
Alexandria. However, he is compelled to return to Rome when the empire is
threatened by the rebellion of Sextus Pompey, the son of Pompey, who had been
defeated by Julius Caesar.

As his wife has just died Antony marries Octavius’ sister, Octavia, in an attempt
to heal the rift between the two emperors. They make peace with Pompey. When
Cleopatra hears about Antony’s marriage she flies into a jealous rage but knows
that Antony does not love Octavia. Antony goes to Athens but when war breaks out
between Caesar and Pompey, Antony sends Octavia back to Rome and returns to Egypt.

Caesar is incensed with Antony’s behaviour and he declares war on both Antony
and Cleapatra. When the Romans arrive Antony is offered a choice of how to fight
and, despite being renowned as the world’s greatest soldier, he chooses to fight
on sea. The Egyptian navy is inadequate and when Cleopatra’s navy turns and flees,
Antony follows them and Caesar defeats him.

Cleopatra goes to her tomb and sends a message to Antony that she is dead.
Antony is devastated and decides to kill himself. He botches the suicide and
wounds himself without dying. His followers take him to Cleopatra’s tomb, where
he dies in her arms.

Cleopatra’s life is in tatters. Having lost Antony and being at the mercy of
Caesar, she resolves to commit suicide. She has someone bring her some poisonous
snakes and incites them to bite her. Caesar arrives just after her death and
orders that the twolovers be buried together.
