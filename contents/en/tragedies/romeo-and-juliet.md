# Romeo and Juliet

On a hot morning fighting by young servants of the Capulet and Montague families
is stopped by the Prince who tells them that the next person who breaks the peace
will be punished with death.

Capulet plans a feast to introduce his daughter, Juliet, who is almost fourteen,
to the Count Paris who would like to marry her. By a mistake of the illiterate
servant Peter, Montague’s son, Romeo, and his friends Benvolio and the Prince’s
cousin Mercutio, hear of the party and decide to go in disguise. Romeo hopes he
will see his adored Rosaline but instead he meets and falls in love with Juliet.

Juliet’s cousin Tybalt recognises the Montagues and they are forced to leave the
party just as Romeo and Juliet have each discovered the other’s identity. Romeo
lingers near the Capulet’s house and talks to Juliet when she appears on her
balcony. With the help of Juliet’s Nurse the lovers arrange to meet next day at
the cell of Friar Lawrence when Juliet goes for confession, and they are married
by him.

Tybalt picks a quarrel with Mercutio and his friends and Mercutio is accidentally
killed as Romeo intervenes to try to break up the fight. Romeo pursues Tybalt in
anger, kills him and is banished by the Prince for the deed. Juliet is anxious
that Romeo is late meeting her and learns of the fighting from her Nurse. With
Friar Lawrence’s help it is arranged that Romeo will spend the night with Juliet
before taking refuge at Mantua.

To calm the family’s sorrow at Tybalt’s death the day for the marriage of Juliet
to Paris is brought forward. Capulet and his wife are angry that Juliet does not
wish to marry Paris, not knowing of her secret contract with Romeo.

Friar Lawrence helps Juliet by providing a sleeping potion that will make
everyone think she’s dead. Romeo will then come to her tomb and take her away.
When the wedding party arrives to greet Juliet next day they think she is dead.
The Friar sends a colleague to warn Romeo to come to the Capulet’s family
monument to rescue his sleeping wife but the message doesn’t get through and
Romeo, hearing instead that Juliet is dead, buys poison in Mantua.

He returns to Verona and goes to the tomb where he surprises and kills the
mourning Paris. Romeo takes the poison and dies just as Juliet awakes from her
drugged sleep. She learns what has happened from Friar Lawrence but she refuses
to leave the tomb and stabs herself as the Friar returns with the Prince, the
Capulets and Romeo’s father. The deaths of their children lead the families to
make peace, promising to erect a monument in their memory.
