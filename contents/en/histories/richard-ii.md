# King Richard II

Henry Bolingbroke, son of the great John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, challenges
Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, accusing him of being involved in the recent
death of the King’s uncle, the Duke of Gloucester. The challenge is to be
answered by a tournament at King Richar’s court in Coventry, but the wayward and
uncertain Richard stops the contest as it is about to begin. He banishes Mowbray
for life and, responding to Lancaster’s pleas, he commutes Bolingbroke’s exile
to six years.

Richard enjoys the companionship of his cousin Aumerle, son of the Duke of York,
and of Bushy, Bagot and Green, who are seen as hangers on, misleading him into
the misgovernment of England. Gaunt dies, finally broken by his son’s banishment,
and by the state in which he sees the kingdom under Richard’s rule. Richard
ignores Gaunt’s advice and, to the horror of his last surviving uncle, the Duke
of York, claim’s Gaunt’s estates, using the money to fund an expedition against
the Irish. He leaves York as regent in England. Bolingbroke, angered that his
inheritance has been confiscated, returns with an invading army and is welcomed
by the English who are led by the powerful Earl of Northumberland, Henry Percy.

Richard, arrives back to find his Welsh allies have dispersed and that York, who
has been unable to prevent Bolingbroke’s triumphant return, has joined the
invader. Otherfriends have abandoned the king, and Bushy and Green have been
executed on Bolingbroke’s orders. After taking refuge at Flint castle, Richard
agrees to go to Londonwhere the case is considered in Parliament.

King Richard is persuaded to abdicate in favour of Henry Bolingbroke, who becomes
Henry 1V. Aumerle joins with the Bishop of Carlisle and the Abbot of Westminster
in a plot against Henry but is discovered by his father, York. Loyal to the new
regime, York tells Bolingbroke of his son’s treachery and Aurmerle is saved only
by his mother’s pleas to King Henry.

Richard is imprisoned in Pontefract castle and his Queen is sent home to France.
Pierce of Exton, misinterpreting King Henry’s wishes, murders Richard and brings
the body toLondon. The play ends with King Henry swearing to make reparation for
his cousin’s death by going one day on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
