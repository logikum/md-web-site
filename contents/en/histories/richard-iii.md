# Richard III

Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is determined to gain the crown of England from his
brother, the Yorkist King Edward IV. He woos the widow, Lady Ann at the funeral
of her father-in-law, King Henry VI. She yields to his advances and marries him.
In the meantime, Richard organises the murder of his brother George, Duke of
Clarence, whom he has had imprisoned in the Tower of London.

The king, Edward IV is ill and Richard, assisted by Lord Hastings, is appointed
as regent. He places the young sons of Edward in the Tower and consolidates his
power with the help of Buckingham, who gains the support of the Lord Mayor of
London and his followers on Richard’s behalf. The king dies and Richard is
proclaimed king. He has Hastings executed for attempting to frustrate his plans.
The young princes are murdered in the Tower. Edward’s widow, Elizabeth, with the
sons of her first marriage, fearing for their lives, flee. Buckingham is
suspicious of Richard’s role in the murder of the young princes. He tries to
blackmail Richard, demanding an earldom, and when his demand is denied he tries
to raise an army against Richard. He is captured and executed. Richard plans to
marry Edward IV’s daughter, Elizabeth.

Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, the heir to the Lancastrian claim to the throne,
makes war on Richard. They meet at Bosworth. On the eve of the battle Richard is
haunted by the ghosts of his victims. He is killed in the battle and Henry Tudor
succeeds him, becoming Henry VII of England. The play ends with him planning to
marry Elizabeth of York and end the Wars of the Roses.
