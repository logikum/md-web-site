# Henry VI, Part I

The play opens in the aftermath of the death of King Henry V. News reaches
England of military setbacks in France, and the scene shifts to Orleans, where
‘La Pucelle’ (Joan of Arc) is encouraging the Dauphin to resist. She defeats an
English army led by Talbot.

In England, Richard, Duke of York, quarrels with John Beaufort, 1 st Duke of
Somerset about his claim on the throne. The lords select red or white roses,
depending on whether they favour the House of Lancaster or that of York. Edmund
Mortimer, a leading claimant to the throne, is a prisoner in the Tower of London
and declares Richard his heir. The young Henry VI honours both Richard and Talbot.

Talbot dies bravely in his next battle against the French. In the meantime, King
Henry is married off to a young French princess, Margaret of Anjou. Suffolk
intends to control the king through Margaret. Ill feeling between him and the
Duke of Gloucester continues to grow.
