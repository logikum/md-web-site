# Henry VI, Part II

This play begins with the marriage of King Henry VI to the young Margaret of
Anjou. William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, aims to influence the king through
her. The major obstacle to this plan is the regent of the crown, Humphrey, Duke
of Gloucester, who is very popular with the people. Queen Margaret vies with his
wife, Eleanor, for precedence at court. Eleanor is lured by an agent of Suffolk
into dabbling in necromancy, and then arrested, to the embarrassment of her
husband, Gloucester. Nevertheless, the demon she has summoned delivers some
accurate prophecies concerning the fates of several characters in the play.
Gloucester is then accused of treason and imprisoned, and afterwards assassinated
by agents of Suffolk and the Queen.

Meanwhile, Richard, Duke of York, who has a tenuous claim to the throne, schemes
to make himself king.

The Earl of Suffolk is banished for his role in Gloucester’s death and killed by
Walter the pirate, leaving Margaret without her mentor.

Meanwhile, Richard of York has managed to become commander of an army to suppress
a revolt in Ireland. York enlists a former officer, Jack Cade, to lead a rebellion
that threatens the whole kingdom, so that he can bring his army from Ireland into
England and seize the throne.

As Cade’s rebels are routed, York, who has brought his army over on the pretext
of protecting the King from Somerset, declares open war on the king, supported
by his sons, Edward (the future King Edward IV) and Richard (the future King
Richard II).

The English nobility now take sides, and the Battle of St Albans ensues. The
Duke of Somerset is killed by the future Richard III. Young Lord Clifford, whose
father has been killed by the Duke of York, vows revenge on the Yorkists, and
allies himself with King Henry’s other supporters.
