# King John

King John has been betrayed by his nephew, Arthur who, backed by the French King,
is conducting a rebellion. The King of France demands that he surrender his
throne but, instead, John sends a force against the him under Philip Faulconbridge.
The armies clash at Angiers but there is no decisive victory. John makes a peace
settlement with the French King.

John is, in the meantime, having a problem with the Pope. The Pope has
excommunicated him, and his envoy, Pandulph, orders the French King to resume
hostilities with John. During one of the battles John captures his nephew,
Arthur. He gives orders for his execution but his chamberlain, Hubert, disobeys
the order. While trying to escape, Arthur falls to his death. The nobles accuse
John of murder and defect to the French side. John is forced to hand over his
crown to Pandulph, although receives it back, but his kingdom is now under the
Pope’s control.

Pandulph now tries to stop the conflict but the French won’t co-operate and the
armies meet at Edmundsbury. The nobles don’t trust the French King and they
return to John. The French King comes to terms with John through Pandulph but
John is not there to see that as he is poisoned by a monk while he is staying at
Swinstead Abbey. He is succeeded by his son, King Henry III.
