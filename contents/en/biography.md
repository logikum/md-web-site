# The Life of William Shakespeare (1564–1616)

Within the class system of Elizabethan England, William Shakespeare did not seem
destined for greatness. He was not born into a family of nobility or significant
wealth. He did not continue his formal education at university, nor did he come
under the mentorship of a senior artist, nor did he marry into wealth or prestige.
His talent as an actor seems to have been modest, since he is not known for
starring roles. His success as a playwright depended in part upon royal patronage.
Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read
playwright in the world.

Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter
of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in
Stratford-upon-Avon. At that time, infants were baptized three days after their
birth, thus scholars believe that Shakespeare was born on April 23, the same day
on which he died at age 52. As the third of eight children, young William grew
up in this small town 100 miles northwest of London, far from the cultural and
courtly center of England.

Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, King's New School, where the
curriculum would have stressed a classical education of Greek mythology, Roman
comedy, ancient history, rhetoric, grammar, Latin, and possibly Greek. Throughout
his childhood, Shakespeare's father struggled with serious financial debt.
Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend
university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight
years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born
in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585. In the seven years following
their birth, the historical record concerning Shakespeare is incomplete,
contradictory, and unreliable; scholars refer to this period as his “lost years.”

In a 1592 pamphlet by Robert Greene, Shakespeare reappears as an “upstart crow”
flapping his poetic wings in London. Evidently, it did not take him long to land
on the stage. Between 1590 and 1592, Shakespeare's _Henry VI_ series, _Richard III_,
and _The Comedy of Errors_ were performed. When the theaters were closed in 1593
because of the plague, the playwright wrote two narrative poems, _Venus and Adonis_
and _The Rape of Lucrece_, and probably began writing his richly textured sonnets.
One hundred and fiftyfour of his sonnets have survived, ensuring his reputation
as a gifted poet. By 1594, he had also written, _The Taming of the Shrew_, _The Two
Gentlemen of Verona_ and _Love's Labor's Lost_.

Having established himself as an actor and playwright, in 1594 Shakespeare became
a shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, one of the most popular acting
companies in London. He remained a member of this company for the rest of his
career, often playing before the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare entered
one of his most prolific periods around 1595, writing _Richard II_, _Romeo and
Juliet_, _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, and _The Merchant of Venice_. With his
newfound success, Shakespeare purchased the second largest home in Stratford in
1597, though he continued to live in London. Two years later, he joined others
from the Lord Chamberlain's Men in establishing the polygonal Globe Theatre on
the outskirts of London. When King James came to the throne in 1603, he issued a
royal license to Shakespeare and his fellow players, organizing them as the
King's Men. During King James's reign, Shakespeare wrote many of his most
accomplished plays about courtly power, including _King Lear_, _Macbeth_, and
_Antony and Cleopatra_. In 1609 or 1611, Shakespeare's sonnets were published,
though he did not live to see the First Folio of his plays published in 1623.

In 1616, with his health declining, Shakespeare revised his will. Since his only
son Hamnet had died in 1596, Shakespeare left the bulk of his estate to his two
daughters, with monetary gifts set aside for his sister, theater partners,
friends, and the poor of Stratford. A fascinating detail of his will is that he
bequeathed the family's “second best bed” to his wife Anne. He died one month
later, on April 23, 1616. To the world, he left a lasting legacy in the form of
38 plays, 154 sonnets, and two narrative poems.

When William Shakespeare died in his birthplace of Stratford-upon- Avon, he was
recognized as one of the greatest English playwrights of his era. In the four
centuries since, he has come to be seen as not only a great English playwright,
but the greatest playwright in the English language. Reflecting upon the
achievement of his peer and sometimes rival, Ben Jonson wrote of Shakespeare,
“He was not of an age, but for all time.”
