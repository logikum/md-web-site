# As You Like It

Orlando, the youngest son of Sir Roland de Boys, is ill treated by his brother
Oliver. When he responds to the general challenge issued by the Duke’s wrestler,
Charles, Oliver tells Charles to injure Orlando if he can manage it. The Duke’s
daughter, Celia, and her cousin, Rosalind, watch the match and Rosalind falls in
love with Orlando. Orlando wins but the Duke gets angry when he discovers that
Orlando is the son of his old enemy, Sir Roland de Boys. Rosalind gives Orlando
a chain to wear and he falls in love with her.

The Duke unexpectedly banishes Rosalind and she decides to find her father, the
real Duke, who has been overthrown by his brother, Celia’s father, Frederick.
Duke Senior lives in the forest of Arden. Together with the court jester,
Touchstone, the girls set out, disguised as a country boy, Ganymede, and his
sister, Aliena. Co-incidentally, Orlando, fearing for his life, has also left
home, accompanied by his father’s servant, Adam.

In the forest, the group from the court encounter a young shepherd, Silvius, and
watch him being rejected by a shepherdess, Phoebe, as he declares his love for
her. They meet an old shepherd, Corin, who is looking for someone to take over
the sheep farm. Ganymede, who wants to settle in the forest, buys the lease.

Duke Senior, unaware that his daughter is looking for him, is living a simple
life with some courtiers and huntsmen. One of them is the melancholy Jaques, who
reflects constantly on life. Orlando and Adam arrive and the outlaws welcome
them and feed them.

Orlando hangs some love poems that he has written to Rosalind from the branches
of trees. Rosalind and Aliena find them. Ganymede helps him to cure his
lovesickness by wooing him, Ganymede, as though he/she were Rosalind. A country
girl, Audrey, falls in love with Touchstone and abandons her faithful William
because of her love for the fool.

Oliver is searching for his brother. He has an accident and Orlando saves his
life. Orlando is slightly injured and when he tells Ganymede about it she faints.
Oliver and Celia fall in love. Phoebe falls in love with Genymede. It all becomes
very complicated. Hymen leads a masque; Rosalind re-emerges as a woman and her
father gives her to Orlando; Phoebe accepts Silvius; Orlando’s older brother
returns from university with the news that Celia’s father, Frederick, has retired
as Duke to become a hermit; Jaques goes to join him. There is a joyful dance to
celebrate the four marriages and the happy ending.
