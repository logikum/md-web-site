# Pericles, Prince of Tyre

Pericles, the Prince of Tyre flees Antioch and goes back to Tyre because he
knows that Antiochus, the King of Antioch, is having an incestuous affair with
his daughter. Antiochus is determined to kill him and pursues him. Pericles
flees again, first to Tyre and then to Pentopolis. He leaves Tyre in the care
of his counsellor, Helicanus. En route the ship is wrecked and Pericles is the
only survivor.

While in Pentopolis, Pericles wins a tournament where the prize is Thaisa, the
beautiful daughter of Simonides. They fall in love and Pericles marries her.
Soon after that the news arrives that Antiochus is dead: also that the people of
Tyre want their prince to return to them. Thaisa is pregnant now, and on the way
to Tyre a storm at sea brings about the birth of her child, whom Pericles calls
Marina. Thaisa apparently dies in childbirth. The grieving Pericles seals her in
a watertight coffin and buries her at sea.

The coffin floats on the sea and finally ends up on the coast of Ephesus. Cerimon
revives Thaisa. She mistakenly believes that Pericles has been lost at sea and
she commits herself as a votress (a nun) in the Temple of Diana. In the meantime,
Pericles has visited Tarsus and left Marina with Cleon, the governor of Tarsus,
and his wife, Dionyza, who have undertaken to raise her.

There is a sixteen year gap in the action. Marina is now a beautiful young woman.
Dionyza is jealous of her and makes up her mind to have her killed. She instructs
a servant to take her out in a ship and murder her but before he can do that she
is captured by pirates. The servant returns and tells Dionyza that heâ€™s killed
her. Cleon builds a monument to her.

When Pericles visits Tarsus he sees the monument and falls into a pit of despair.
In the meantime the pirates have sold Marina to a brothel in Mitylene but she is
almost immediately freed by the governor, Lysismachus.

Pericles arrives in Mitylene and encounters her. He talks to her without at
first knowing who she is. He soon recognises her, however, and there is a joyful
reunion. Lysismachus proposes to Marina and she accepts him. Pericles then has a
dream in which he is instructed to go to Ephesus. He takes Marina with him. When
they arrive they meets Thaisa, who is now the head priestess of Diana, and the
family is happily reunited.
