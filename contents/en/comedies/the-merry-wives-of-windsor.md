# The Merry Wives of Windsor

Sir John Falstaff is in financial difficulties. On top of that, Justice Shallow
and his youthful cousin, Slender, have come to Windsor because he has conned
them out of money. Falstaff decides to woo the wives of two of Windsor’s leading
merchants, Page, and Ford, to get money out of them. He sends his page, Robin,
to each of the wives with a letter. The wives compare the letters and find that
they are identical.

They decide to teach him a lesson and devise a plan. They invite him to Mistress
Ford’s house at a time when Ford will be out bird shooting. Falstaff’scompanions,
Pistol and Nym, tell Ford about Falstaff’s intentions and Ford, a naturally
jealous man, resolves to catch his wife out. He disguises himself as a shy man,
Master Brook, with a passion for Mistress Ford, and goes to Falstaff and offers
him money to woo her on his behalf. Falstaff tells him that a meeting has already
been arranged and agrees to Master Brook’s request.

Slender has made friends with a local clergyman, Parson Evans. Slender has fallen
for Page’s daughter, Anne, who is already secretly meeting a young courtier,
Fenton, of whom Page disapproves. Anne’s mother, Mistress Page, is determined
that she will marry the French doctor, Caius. When Caius hears about Slender’s
suit he challenges Parson Evans to a duel. The landlord of the Garter Inn confuses
matters by setting different places for the duel, which results in the antagonists
making up their differences.

Falstaff arrives at Mistress Ford’s house but his wooing is interrupted by
Mistress Page’s announcement that the men are returning. They hide Falstaff in
a large laundry basket and he is carried out. Ford searches the house. Falstaff
is tipped out on a muddy river bank. The wives, amused by the incident, decide
to repeat the incident and invite Falstaff to come again. He is reluctant but
Master Brook persuades hnbim to accept and his visit is again interrupted by
Ford’s return. Ford searches the laundry basket but this time Falstaff is
disguised as the elderly aunt of one of the servants. When Ford finds nothing
in the laundry basket he loses his temper and angrily beats the ‘aunt’ out of
the house. The wives laughingly tell their husbands about the trick and Page
suggests that they should publicly humiliate Falstaff to stop him from preying
on honest wives.

Mistress Ford invites Falstaff to meet her at night in Windsor Park, disguised
as Hearne the Hunter. Parson Evans organises Anne and some children to dress as
fairies. Anne plans to elope with Fenton, while her parents are plotting her
kidnapping by Caius and a secret marriage to him. They all meet in the park and
Falstaff is pinched and taunted by the fairies. Anne escapes and returns as
Fenton’s wife, while Cauius and Slender both find that they have eloped with
boys. The play ends with the Pages giving their blessing to Anne’s marriage and
everyone laughing at the evening’s antics and the humiliation of Falstaff.
