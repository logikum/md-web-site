# The Comedy of Errors

n Ephesus, ruled by Duke Solinus, Egeon, a merchant of Syracuse, stands trial
for landing in a country where Syracusians are banned. Egeon explains how 23
years before he had lost his wife and one of their identical twin sons, with the
boy’s companion, also an identical twin boy, in a storm at sea. Egeon had brought
up the surviving boys but at eighteen they had gone in search of their lost
brothers. Not hearing from them Egeon had also left home to seek news and has
now arrived at Ephesus. Solinus is softened by the story and allows Egeon until
sunset to try to raise 1000 marks ransom, or he must die.

Meanwhile, in a nearby marketplace a merchant has befriended two tourists,
Antipholus of Syracuse (Egeon’s son) and his servant companion, Dromio. Learning
of the ban on Syracusians, they take on local dress before going to explore the
town, where, unknown to them, their twin brothers have been living after being
saved from the storm by fishermen who brought them up in Corinth.

Antipholus of Syracuse is much surprised to be accosted by Dromio of Ephesus who
is angry that his master has not returned home to his wife, Adriana, for dinner.
The likeness of the Dromio twins to each other, and also between the sons of
Egeon leads to a series of confusions whereby Antipholus of Syracuse dines with
his sister-in- law and at the same time falls in love with her sister, Luciana.
His servant prevents entry to their own home by Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus
and their merchant friends. This exclusion leads Antipholus to resort to his
friend the courtesan.

A chain previously ordered from Angelo, the goldsmith, is delivered to the wrong
Antipholus and Angelo’s claim for payment leads to the arrest of Antipholus of
Ephesus and his servant, while Adriana, fearing for her husband’s sanity gets
Dr. Pinch, the schoolmaster, to exorcise them. While they are under restraint
their Syracusian brothers cause panic in the town but, frightened themselves,
they take refuge in a priory.

The sunset hour of Egeon’s sentence arrives, and the Duke returns but is stopped
by Adriana who appeals for aid as he has befriended her husband in the past. The
Ephesian twins, having escaped their bonds, arrive to claim justice and Egeon
recognises them, as he thinks, the boys he brought up in Syracuse. Solinus sends
for the Abbess who appears, to everyone’s surprise, with the second pair of twins.
She further amazes everyone by recognising Egeon. She is Aemilia, his long-lost
wife, who, surviving the storm and fearing all her family to be dead, had entered
a religious order.

When all have told their stories Antipholus of Syracuse renews his suit to
Luciana, the Duke pardons Egeon, and everyone goes to celebrate the reunions at
the home of Adriana and Antipholus of Ephesus. Dromio of Syracuse happily passes
the attentions of Adriana’s servant girl, who has pursued him since the dinner
at Adriana’s house, back to his brother and the two joyfully leave the stage
hand in hand.
