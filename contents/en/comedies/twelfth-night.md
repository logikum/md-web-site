# Twelfth Night

Orsino, the Duke of lllyria, is in love with his neighbour, the Countess Olivia.
She has sworn to avoid men’s company for seven years while she mourns the death
of her brother, so rejects him. Nearby a group of sailors arrive on shore with
a young woman, Viola, who has survived a shipwreck in a storm at sea. Viola
mourns the loss of her twin brother but decides to dress as a boy to get work as
a page to Duke Orsino.

Despite his rejection Orsino sends his new page Cesario (Viola in disguise) to
woo Olivia on his behalf. Viola goes unwillingly as she has already fallen in
love at first sight with the duke. Olivia is attracted by the ‘boy’ and she
sends her pompous steward, Malvolio, after him with a ring.

Olivia’s uncle, Sir Toby Belch, her servant Maria, and Sir Toby’s friend, Sir
Andrew Aguecheek, who is also hoping to woo Olivia, and is being led on by Sir
Toby, who is trying to fleece him of his money, all plot to expose the self-love
of Malvolio. By means of a false letter they trick him into thinking his mistress
Olivia loves him. Malvolio appears in yellow stockings and cross-garters, smiling
as they have told him to in the letter. Unaware of the trick the Countess is
horrified and has Malvolio shut up in the dark as a madman.

Meanwhile Viola’s twin brother, Sebastian, who has also survived the shipwreck,
comes to Illyria. His sea-captain friend, Antonio, is a wanted man for piracy
against Orsino. The resemblance between Cesario and Sebastian leads the jealous
Sir Andrew to challenge Cesario to a duel. Antonio intervenes to defend Cesario
whom he thinks is his friend Sebastian, and is arrested. Olivia has in the
meantime met and become betrothed to Sebastian.

Cesario is accused of deserting both Antonio and Olivia when the real Sebastian
arrives to apologise for fighting Sir Toby. Seeing both twins together, all is
revealed to Olivia. Orsino’s fool, Feste, brings a letter from Malvolio and on
his release the conspirators confess to having written the false letter. Malvolio
departs promising revenge. Maria and Sir Toby have married in celebration of the
success of their device against the steward.

The play ends as Orsino welcomes Olivia and Sebastian and, realising his own
attraction to Cesario, he promises that once she is dressed as a woman again
they, too, will be married.
