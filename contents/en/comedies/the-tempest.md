# The Tempest

Alonso, the king of Naples, is returning from his daughter’s wedding in Tunis.
He is accompanied by his son, Ferdinand, his brother, Sebastain, and Antonio,
the Duke of Milan. An old Milanese courtier, Gonzalo, is also on board. The ship
is wrecked in a storm and all the passengers and crew are thrown into the
furious sea.

Prospero, the former Duke of Milan, and his fifteen year-old daughter, Miranda,
are watching the shipwreck from an island. He tells her, for the first time, how
they came to be on the island. Twelve years before, when he had been Duke of
Milan, his brother Antonio, had usurped him, but with Gonzalo’s help he had
escaped in a small boat with his baby daughter, Miranda, and his library of
books about magic. They had ended up on the island and Prospero had turned the
only inhabitant, Caliban, a deformed and savage creature, into his slave. There
are also spirits on the island. One of them, Ariel, had been imprisoned in a
tree trunk by Caliban’s mother, the witch, Sycorax, who had then died. Prospero
used his magic abilities to rescue him and he made the spirit swear to serve him.

The ship’s passengers are cast up on the island unharmed, and even their clothes
are not wet or damaged. Alonso believes his son to be dead but Ferdinand has
landed on another part of the island. He encounters Miranda and they fall in
love at first sight. He is the first man, apart from her father and Caliban that
she has ever seen. Prospero puts Ferdinand to work manually, controlling all
his movements with magic. Ariel pesters Prospero for his freedom and Prospero
promises it once he has done some things for him, regarding the newcomers.

Ariel leads the party towards Prospero’s cell. During this journey Antonio and
Sebastian plan to kill Alonso so that Sebastian can be king. Two other members
of the party, Trinculo, the court jester, and Stephano, a boisterous butler, are
also wandering about on the island. Caliban recruits them to help him overthrow
Prospero. They all get drunk then set off for Prospero’s cell. Ariel reports the
plot to Prospero.

Prospero has released Ferdinand and given his blessing to the marriage of the
two young people. When the three would-be usurpers arrive at his cell they are
distracted by some brightly coloured clothes that have been hung out for them,
then they are chased away by a band of spirits who have taken on the form of dogs.

Ariel brings the party to the cell. Prospero renounces his magic and reveals
himself. He forgives his brother and prepares to return to Milan to resume his
dukedom. Miranda and Ferdinand are betrothed. Sailors arrive and announce that
the ship hasn’t been wrecked after all, and is safely anchored off the island.
Ariel is set free. Caliban and the drunken servants are also forgiven. There is
a final celebration of their reunion.
