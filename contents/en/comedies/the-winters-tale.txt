# The Winter's Tale

Polixenes, the King of Bohemia, has been visiting his old friend King Leontes in
Sicily for nearly nine months but is ready to return to Bohemia. Leontes begs
him to stay longer but Polixenes is anxious to go, and declines. When Leontes’
pregnant wife, Hermione, succeeds in persuading Polixenes to stay, Leontes
becomes obsessed with the thought that his wife has been unfaithful with his
friend. He asks his servant, Camillo, to poison Polixenes, Camilla warns
Polixenes instead and they flee leaving Hermione and her little boy, Mamillius,
to face the King’s displeasure.

Leontes imprisons Hermione and she delivers a baby girl there. A lady in waiting,
Paulina, takes the baby to Leontes to try and persuade him to accept her.
Instead, Leontes instructs Paulina’s husband, Antigonus, to take the baby into
exile. Leonte’s puts Hermione on trial and she is vindicated by a message from
the Delphic oracle to which Leontes had appealed. Her son Mamillius dies from
heartbreak at his mother’s imprisonment and Hermione collapses and appears to
die. The news of Mamillius’ death shocks Leontes back to reality and he becomes
remorseful.

Antigonus places the baby on a beach in Bohemia but he is killed by a bear and
the baby is left there. A shepherd and his son discover the child and take her
to their home.

Sixteen years pass, during which time Leontes mourns the loss of his wife and
children. In Bohemia, Polixenes’ son, Florizel, has met and fallen in love with
a shepherd’s daughter, Perdita, while she’s organising a sheepshearing feast.
Polixenes and Camillo, in disguise, attend the feast where they are entertained
by dancers and by the rogue Autolycus, who has previously tricked the young
Shepherd and stolen his purse to provide himself with knick-knacks to sell at
the feast. Polixenes reveals himself, reprimands his son, and threatens the
shepherds for promoting Perdita’s friendship with the Prince.

Camillo and Autolycus help Florizel and Perdita to run away to Sicily. They are
followed by the shepherds, who in turn are pursued by Polixenes and Camillo. At
Leontes’ court Florizel introduces Perdita then, as Polixenes arrives, the
revelations of the shepherds show Perdita to be the banished daughter of Leontes.
Everyone goes with Paulina to see a newly completed statue of Hermione and the
statue moves. Hermione has lived in seclusion in the belief that her daughter
will be found. Florizel and Perdita are united. Leontes and Hermione are also
united and, as a reward, Paulina is given Camillo as her new husband.
