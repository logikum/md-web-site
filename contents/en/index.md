# The Importance of Shakespeare

In a world where the quality of the art form called "writing" is so often said
to be rapidly diminishing, it is important for scholars of English literature to
retain some studies of the true classics, such as Shakespeare. A well-rounded
education logically must have a strong foundation in both modern and classical
literature, the latter of which an in-depth study of Shakespearean works would
more than satisfy. Not only was Shakespeare so well accomplished in his writing
skills that he has become an undeniably significant point in the history of
literature, but a majority of his works were written on such basic human themes
that they will endure for all time and must not be allowed to slip into the
tragic oblivion of old age.

William Shakespeare has become an important landmark in English literature. To
see why this is so crucial for students to study, let us consider an analogy.
One must be familiar with the conditions and circumstances of colonial America
and pre-Revolutionary times if s/he is to understand the rationale behind many
of the provisions of the Constitution, a two-hundred-year-old document still
alive and highly significant today. In much the same way, one must be familiar
with the early days of English literature in order to comprehend the foundation
beneath much of more modern literature’s basis. Shakespeare’s modern influence
is still seen clearly in many ways. For example, the success of Shakespeare’s
works helped to set the precedent for the evolution of modern dramas and plays.
He is also credited with being one of the first writers to use any modern prose
in his writings; in fact, the growth of the popularity of prose in Shakespeare’s
time is clearly shown as he used prose progressively more throughout his career.
<sup>1</sup>

Furthermore, there can be no doubt that Shakespeare was a master of the artistry
of the English language. He wrote with such fluidity of thought, word, rhythm,
and sound that the work is presented in a complex manner, but is not unintelligible,
even for the inexperienced reader. Often a single line would have several different
meanings, each providing us with insight into a character or plot. For example,
five lines from a scene from Richard III present much more than at first observed:

<p class="verse">_Rivers_. Have patience, madam; there’s no doubt his Majesty  
Will soon recover his accustomed health.  
_Grey_. In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.  
Therefore for God’s sake entertain good comfort  
And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.  
_Queen Elizabeth_. If [the King] were dead, what would betide on me?  
_Grey_. No other harm but loss of such a lord.  
_Queen Elizabeth_. The loss of such a lord includes all  
harms. <sup>2</sup> (1.3.1-8)</p>

At a first glance, these characters seem only to be concerned about the poor
health of their King. Yet each line reveals something about each character. Lord
Rivers cares nothing for the King’s well being, and desires only to comfort the
Queen, so that he might be well in her favor and possibly gain some higher
position. Lord Grey knows nothing of the King’s true condition, and honestly
foolishly believes he will recover. The Queen is far more concerned with what
will become of her once the King is dead, than she is concerned about the death
of her husband. The fact that all this might be gathered from so few words is a
sign of a very skilled and crafty author, one which certainly must be studied
and learned from.

Another sign of a truly paramount writer is one who finds even the entire existing
vocabulary of his language limiting to his creative consciousness; Shakespeare
often did, and so on occasion created his own form of grammar and vocabulary,
much of which has since become common use. (A few examples of these would be the
words "amazement", "dislocate", "premeditated", "dexterously", "windle",
"lackluster," using the masculine singular pronoun—"his" for "its" —now used for
poetic effect, and using some nouns as verbs, such as "he childed as I fathered.")
<sup>3</sup>. Few modern writers have such skill as to create new words which
"stick" in our language, or to write in such a way that their words become common
usage centuries later.

By using just the right combination of words, or by conjuring just the right
image, Shakespeare authored countless passages and entire plays so powerful,
poignant, comedic, tragic, and romantic that many are still being routinely
memorized and performed today, nearly four centuries later. Yet the beauty of
Shakespeare’s talent lies not so much in the basic themes of his works as in the
ingenuity with which he painted these portraits of love, power, greed,
discrimination, hatred, and despair. Queen Elizabeth in the movie Shakespeare in
Love (1999) decreed that William Shakespeare was the first author to successfully
put the very essence and truth of love into words; although only a movie, the
decree is nonetheless accurate. It was this truth that he wrote which allowed
his plays to attract both courtiers and peasants to the theatres, for the truths
of humanity are not specific according to wealth or status. Everyone dreams of
having love like Romeo and Juliet; it is for this reason that one of the most
famous Shakespearean scenes is the balcony scene. Wrote Ben Jonson, Shakespeare
is "not of an age, but for all time." 

There can therefore be no doubt that substantial knowledge of the works of
William Shakespeare is necessary for any education of English literature to be
considered complete and well rounded. The extraordinary writing skills with
which Shakespeare created his accurate portrayals of human truth have not been
rivalled or replicated since his death, nearly four hundred years ago. To simply
"skim over" such an integral part of literary history would be to take the
innards out of a living, breathing creature. A creature cannot survive incomplete,
and literature cannot survive without William Shakespeare.
