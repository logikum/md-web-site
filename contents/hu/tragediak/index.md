# Tragédiák

* [Antonius és Kleopátra] (1607-1608)  
  The story of Mark Antony, Roman military leader and triumvir, who is madly
  in love with Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt.  
  Earliest known text: First Folio (1623).

* [Athéni Timon] (1607-1608)  
  Written late in Shakespeare's career, Timon of Athens is criticized as an underdeveloped
  tragedy, likely co-written by George Wilkins or Cyril Tourneur. Read the play and see  
  if you agree.  
  Earliest known text: First Folio (1623).

* [Coriolanus] (1607-1608)  
  The last of Shakespeare's great political tragedies, chronicling the life of
  the mighty warrior Caius Marcius Coriolanus.  
  Earliest known text: First Folio (1623).

* [Hamlet] (1600-1601)  
  Since its first recorded production, Hamlet has engrossed playgoers, thrilled
  readers, and challenged actors more so than any other play in the Western canon.
  No other single work of fiction has produced more commonly used expressions.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1603).

* [Julius Caesar] (1599-1600)  
  Although there were earlier Elizabethan plays on the subject of Julius Caesar and
  his turbulent rule, Shakespeare's penetrating study of political life in ancient
  Rome is the only version to recount the demise of Brutus and the other conspirators.  
  Earliest known text: First Folio (1623).

* [Lear király] (1605-1606)  
  The story of King Lear, an aging monarch who decides to divide his kingdom amongst
  his three daughters, according to which one recites the best declaration of love.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1608).

* [Macbeth] (1605-1606)  
  Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's most stimulating and popular dramas. Renaissance
  records of Shakespeare's plays in performance are scarce, but a detailed account
  of an original production of Macbeth has survived, thanks to Dr. Simon Forman.  
  Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). 

* [Othello] (1604-1605)  
  Othello, a valiant Moorish general in the service of Venice, falls prey to the
  devious schemes of his false friend, Iago.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1622).

* [Rómeó és Júlia] (1594-1595)  
  Celebrated for the radiance of its lyric poetry, Romeo and Juliet was tremendously
  popular from its first performance. The sweet whispers shared by young Tudor lovers
  throughout the realm were often referred to as "naught but pure Romeo and Juliet."  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1597).

* [Titus Andronicus] (1593-1594)  
  A sordid tale of revenge and political turmoil, overflowing with bloodshed and
  unthinkable brutality. The play was not printed with Shakespeare credited as author
  during his lifetime, and critics are divided between whether it is the product of
  another dramatist or simply Shakespeare's first attempt at the genre.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1594).
