# Királydrámák

* [II. Richárd] (1595-1596)  
  More so than Shakespeare's earlier history plays, Richard II is notable for its
  well-rounded characters.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1597).

* [III. Richárd] (1592-1593)  
  The devious machinations of the deformed villain, Richard, duke of Gloucester, made
  this play an Elizabethan favorite.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1597). 

* [IV. Henrik, I. rész] (1597-1598)  
  One of Shakespeare's most popular plays, featuring the opportunistic miscreant,
  Sir John Falstaff.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1598).

* [IV. Henrik, II. rész] (1597-1598)  
  This is the third play in the second tetralogy of history plays, along with
  Richard II, Henry IV, Part 1, and Henry V.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1600).

* [V. Henrik] (1598-1599)  
  Henry V is the last in the second tetralogy sequence. King Henry is considered
  Shakespeare's ideal monarch.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1600).

* [VI. Henrik, I. rész] (1591-1592)  
  The first in Shakespeare's trilogy about the War of the Roses between the houses
  of Lancaster and York.  
  Earliest known text: First Folio (1623).

* [VI. Henrik, II. rész] (1590-1591)  
  Part two of Shakespeare's chronicle play. Based on Hall's work, the play contains
  some historical inaccuracies.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1594).

* [VI. Henrik, III. rész] (1590-1591)  
  Part three begins in medias res, with the duke of Suffolk dead and the duke of
  York being named Henry VI's heir.  
  Earliest known text: Quarto (1595). 

* [VIII. Henrik] (1612-1613)  
  Many believe Henry VIII to be Shakespeare's last play, but others firmly believe
  that he had little, if anything, to do with its creation.  
  Earliest known text: First Folio (1623).

* [János király] (1596-1597)  
  In the shadow of Shakespeare’s second tetralogy of history plays lies the neglected
  masterpiece, King John. Although seldom read or performed today, King John was once
  one of Shakespeare's most popular histories, praised for its poetic brilliance.  
  Earliest known text: First Folio (1623).
